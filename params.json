It is available on [the web](http://goo.gl/U0yzI), on [Android](http://goo.gl/fDa2g) and an iOS version is in development.\r\n\r\nIt is designed to be a *one time use* app. It **does not** constantly poll for your location and update it to the server. Imagine your are at a music festival and want to find your friends:\r\n\r\n* Start the app: a private room is created for you\r\n* Share the room link to your friends using your favorite IM app\r\n* Everyone opens the app with the private room. Their position is updated in real time\r\n* Regroup with your friends\r\n* **That's it: you found your friends!**\r\n* Close the app: the room is closed forever, the app stops sending your position\r\n\r\nNo sign-up is needed. Your friends that do not have the app can use the web version and don't have to download the app before being able to share their position with you. \r\n\r\n![Where Are You logo](assets/logo.png)\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nWhereAreYou uses [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) to power the real time position updates.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in a particular platform, your can clone their own git repo:\r\n\r\n* [Android](https://github.com/jschmid/WhereAreYou-Android)\r\n* [iOS](https://github.com/jschmid/WhereAreYou-iOS)\r\n* [Web](https://github.com/jschmid/WhereAreYou-Web)\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in all platforms, you can use this particular git repo that contains all platforms as submobules. Setup your environment with:\r\n\r\n    git clone git@github.com:jschmid/WhereAreYou.git\r\n    git submodule init\r\n    git submodule update\r\n\r\n### Update the submodules\r\n\r\nGit submodules stay with a specific version. To update the projects and commit them back to Github, execute:\r\n\r\n    ./update.sh\r\n","google":"UA-17932364-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
